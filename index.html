			<h1>Hello, I'm Hector !</h1>

			<p>
				Currently a first year student at IESEG Paris, my main objective is to acquire a maximum of skills in several fields in order to create my own business.

			<h2>Sports</h2>
			<p>
				Being a very competitive person, sport is an important part of my life. I have played many sports, including judo and tennis, where I have competed in various competitions. I now surf regularly, having become addicted to the sport. I keep this state of mind in my work, and this is what allowed me to be valedictorian at the IESEG School of Management.

			<h2>Entrepreneur</h2>
			<p>
				At a very young age, I started a YouTube channel project. I was able to develop many partnerships and create a loyal community. I have learned to use YouTube's algorithms to my advantage, while offering diversified content that meets the expectations of my subscribers. I also started designing video games at the same time as YouTube: this allowed me to invest in equipment and save for future purchases.

			<h2>Adventurer & Curious</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about new experiences and thrills. I am someone who likes to discover new things, new sports, artistic practices, new countries, new cultures, and so on. I like renewal, challenges, learning more about what surrounds me. Being deeply curious, as soon as I discover something, I always try to dig into the subject as much as possible.
